\title{Thornthwaite and Mather's water balance}
\usage{
thornthwaite(series, latitude, clim_norm = NULL, first.yr = NULL,
  last.yr = NULL, quant = c(0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1),
  snow.init = 20, Tsnow = -1, TAW = 100, fr.sn.acc = 0.95,
  snow_melt_coeff = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{the monthly series of temperature and precipitation.}

\item{latitude}{latitude of the station in degrees.}

\item{clim_norm}{climatic normals.}

\item{first.yr}{first year of the period over which water balance is calculated. Default is \code{NULL} (calculations start with the first year of the series).}

\item{last.yr}{last year of the period over which water balance is calculated. Default is \code{NULL} (calculations stop with the last year of the series).}

\item{quant}{vector of quantiles for which water balance has to be assessed. Default is: min, 10th, 25th 50th, 75th, 90th, max.}

\item{snow.init}{initial water equivalent for snowpack (mm). Default is 20.}

\item{Tsnow}{maximum temperature (monthly mean) for precipitation to be treated as snowfall. Default is -1 degree C.}

\item{TAW}{maximum (field capacity) for soil water retention, and initial soil water content (mm). Default is 100.}

\item{fr.sn.acc}{fraction of snow that contributes to snowpack (0-1). 1 - fr.sn.acc is treated as liquid monthly precipitation Default is 0.95.}

\item{snow_melt_coeff}{monthly coefficient(s) for snowmelt. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
A \code{thornthwaite} S3 object, consisting on a list of two lists. The first (name: W_balance) is a list of data frames containing the monthly series of all indices, the second (name: quantiles) the relevant quantiles. See details for meanings of single variables.
}
\description{
Calculates Thornthwaite and Mather's water balance from monthly series of precipitation and temperature. Aimed at a classification of a site's climate according to its water balance features.
}
\details{
The algorithm for the calculation of water balance is adapted from Thornthwaite, 1948; Thornthwaite and Mather, 1955; Thornthwaite and Mather, 1957.

\code{series} is a data frame with years, months, temperature and precipitation values. Names in series columns must include: year, month, Tn and Tx (minimum and maximum temperatures, respectively) or, as an alternative, Tm (mean temperatures), and P (mandatory).

\code{clim_norm} is a monthly data frame of climate normals, with column names: "P", "Tn", "Tx", "Tm" (precipitation, minimum, maximum and mean temperature, respectively). It can be the output of function \code{\link{climate}}. If \code{clim_norm} is not NULL, any missing value in the monthly series is substituted by the corresponding climatic value in \code{clim_norm}.

At any winter season, the maximum monthly snowpack height is attained in the last month before "spring" conditions (\code{Tm} >= \code{Tsnow}), even if a month with Tm < Tsnow may occur later.

\code{snow_melt_coeff} is (are) the coefficient(s) for snow melt fraction(s) at any month where the condition for melting exists. If \code{snow_melt_coeff} = 1 (default), all the melting occurs in the first month when \code{Tm >= Tsnow}; if it is a vector, melting is spread over more than one month. If the sum of coefficients is less than 1, the residual melting occurs in one further month.

The output function is a list of two lists of data frames (balance and quantile). In both lists, data frame (and names) are the following (all variables in mm):

\code{Precipitation} (repeats input values);

\code{Et0} (potential evapotranspiration);

\code{Storage} (water stored in soil);

\code{Prec. - Evap.} (difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration);

\code{Deficit} (difference between potential and real evapotranspiration, due to water unavailability in soil);

\code{Surplus} (water surplus in soil, routed to runoff).

Please, refer to the quoted references for details.

This function requires the function \code{\link{daylength}} (libr. \code{\link{geosphere}}).
