\usage{
climate(series, first.yr = NULL, last.yr = NULL, max.perc.missing)
}
\arguments{
\item{series}{the monthly series of temperature and precipitation.}

\item{first.yr}{first year of the period over which climatology is calculated}

\item{last.yr}{last year of the period over which climatology is calculated}

\item{max.perc.missing}{maximum acceptable percentage of missing data in the averaging period from \code{first.yr} to \code{last.yr} (0-99).}
}
\value{
A data frame with climatic monthly values of: precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures (if existing in series), mean temperature (either averaged from existing values in series, or calculated by the function as (Tn + Tx)/2), absolute minimum monthly temperature.
}
\description{
Creates climate mean monthly values from a monthly series of temperature and precipitation.
}
\details{
\code{series} is a data frame with years, months, temperature (and precipitation) values. Names in series columns must include: year, month, Tn and Tx (minimum and maximum temperatures, respectively) or, as an alternative, Tm (mean temperatures).


If \code{first.yr} or  \code{last.yr} are NULL (default), the lowest and highest values in series are taken as the period.
}
\examples{
data(Trent_climate)

# clima_81_10 is a list of data frames of the type series,
# each one referring to one station
# having climatic means of temperature and precipitation

clima_81_10<-lapply(lista_cli, FUN=climate, first.yr=1981, last.yr=2010, max.perc.missing=15)
